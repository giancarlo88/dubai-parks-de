				<h3>Winner Selection and Announcement</h3>

				<p>The winner of the holiday prize will be drawn completely at random from all entries by an independent judge.    </p>

				<p>The winner will be contacted by 30th November 2015, via the email they provided in the entry process.  The winner will have 5 days to respond to the Promoter to accept their prize.

Once the prize winner has accepted the prize, the holiday must be booked no later than 23rd December 2015. Failure to comply with the above will result in the prize being forfeit and a new winner selected at random. The name of the eventual winner will be posted on the Thomas Cook UK and Outfit Facebook page.
